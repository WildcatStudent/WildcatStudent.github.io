        <p>I enjoy drawing, programming, playing piano, and planning projects with my friends. I work at a grocery store as a cashier.
            During the summer, I work in the deli as well as help my Oma with landscaping the Veteran's Home. I own one cat who wakes me up 
            every morning and begs for canned tuna. I hope that learning programming leads to more job opportunities and creative endeavors.
            Working on assignments already gives me ideas for other cool projects I could do.
